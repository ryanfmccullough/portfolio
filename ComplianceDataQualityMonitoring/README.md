## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Ensure healthcare data is complete, consistent, and compliant with regulations.
- **Why It Matters:** Data errors can lead to patient safety risks, billing inaccuracies, and regulatory penalties.

---
## Features
1. **Data Completeness Checks**: Identify missing or invalid fields in patient records.
2. **Regulatory Compliance Audits**: Flag records that may violate HIPAA or CMS interoperability requirements.
3. **Automated Reports**: Generate scheduled reports highlighting anomalies and compliance risks.

---
## Database Setup
*(We’ll define a `patient_records` table or similar. See `schema.sql` for details.)*

---
## Sample Data
*(We’ll add insert statements in `sample_data.sql` to populate the database with test records.)*

---
## Key SQL Queries
*(We’ll include queries in `queries.sql` to audit data completeness and flag potential compliance issues.)*

---
## Usage Instructions
1. **Create the schema** with `schema.sql`.
2. **Insert sample data** with `sample_data.sql`.
3. **Run queries** from `queries.sql` in your SQL environment.

---
## Next Steps
- Integrate with real-time data feeds or EHR systems.
- Expand to additional compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR).
- Automate scheduled audits with scripts or cron jobs.
