-- Query 1: Identify records with missing diagnosis or treatment
SELECT 
    record_id,
    patient_id,
    diagnosis,
    treatment,
    record_date
FROM 
    patient_records
WHERE 
    diagnosis IS NULL OR diagnosis = ''
    OR treatment IS NULL OR treatment = '';

-- Query 2: Calculate a data completeness score (simple example)
SELECT 
    100.0 * (
        COUNT(*) 
        - SUM(
            CASE WHEN (diagnosis IS NULL OR diagnosis = '' 
                      OR treatment IS NULL OR treatment = '')
            THEN 1 
            ELSE 0 
            END
        )
    ) / COUNT(*) AS completeness_score
FROM 
    patient_records;

-- Query 3: List potential compliance issues from the audit log (e.g., unresolved issues)
SELECT 
    audit_id,
    record_id,
    audit_timestamp,
    issue_found,
    resolution_status
FROM 
    compliance_audit_log
WHERE 
    resolution_status = 'open';

-- Query 4: Insert a new compliance issue (example usage)
-- In practice, you'd do something like:
-- INSERT INTO compliance_audit_log (audit_id, record_id, audit_timestamp, issue_found, resolution_status)
-- VALUES (3, 5, '2025-03-20 10:30:00', 'Some new compliance issue', 'open');
-- (This is just a reference, not an actual query to run every time.)
