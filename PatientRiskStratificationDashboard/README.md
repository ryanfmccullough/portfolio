# Patient Risk Stratification Dashboard

This project demonstrates how to segment patients based on risk factors (e.g., frequent hospital admissions, chronic conditions) using SQL queries. The goal is to provide an interactive dashboard or reporting tool that helps healthcare professionals identify and monitor high-risk patient populations.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Leverage healthcare data (patient records, admissions, and conditions) to identify high-risk patients.  
- **Why It Matters:** Healthcare providers need to prioritize patients at greatest risk of complications or readmission, ensuring efficient resource allocation and improved patient outcomes.

---
## Features
1. **SQL-Based Risk Segmentation**  
   - Queries to identify patients with multiple admissions in a given period  
   - Queries to detect chronic conditions (e.g., Diabetes, Hypertension)

2. **Interactive Reporting** *(Optional)*  
   - Export query results into BI tools (Tableau, Power BI) or a Python-based dashboard (Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit)

3. **Trend Analysis**  
   - Potential for analyzing readmission trends over time or monitoring multiple chronic conditions

---
## Database Setup
*(We’ll create tables for `patients`, `admissions`, and `conditions`. See `schema.sql` for details.)*

---
## Sample Data
*(We’ll add insert statements in `sample_data.sql` to populate your database with example patients, admissions, and conditions.)*

---
## Key SQL Queries
*(We’ll include queries in `queries.sql` to identify high-risk patients, detect chronic conditions, and combine results.)*

---
## Dashboard Integration (Optional)
- Outline how to visualize these queries in a dashboard tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Dash).
- Show charts or tables highlighting high-risk patients over time.

---
## Usage Instructions
1. **Create the schema** using `schema.sql`.
2. **Insert sample data** with `sample_data.sql`.
3. **Run queries** from `queries.sql` in your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.).
4. **(Optional) Visualize** data using a BI tool or Python-based dashboard.

---
## Next Steps
- **Refine Risk Criteria:** Incorporate additional data like lab results, medication adherence, or demographic risk factors.
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Monitor patient readmissions or condition progression over multiple years.
- **Automation:** Schedule recurring risk stratification jobs or send alerts to care teams.
