Patient Risk Stratification Dashboard
This project demonstrates how to segment patients based on risk factors (e.g., frequent hospital admissions, chronic conditions) using SQL queries. The goal is to provide an interactive dashboard or reporting tool that helps healthcare professionals identify and monitor high-risk patient populations.

Project Overview
Objective: Leverage healthcare data (patient records, admissions, and conditions) to identify high-risk patients.
Why It Matters: Healthcare providers need to prioritize patients at greatest risk of complications or readmission, ensuring efficient allocation of resources and improved patient outcomes.
Use Case
Care Management Teams: Quickly locate and track patients who have multiple chronic conditions or frequent ER visits.
Data Analysts: Understand patterns in patient populations for better risk modeling and resource planning.
Healthcare Providers: Focus on preventative measures and personalized care plans for high-risk patients.
Features
SQL-Based Risk Segmentation

Queries to identify patients with multiple admissions in a given period.
Queries to detect chronic conditions like Diabetes, Hypertension, etc.
Interactive Reporting (Optional)

Export query results into a BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) or a Python-based dashboard (e.g., Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit).
Trend Analysis

Potential to extend queries for analyzing readmission trends over time.
