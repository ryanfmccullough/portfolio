# Real-Time Care Coordination Analytics

This project showcases how to generate real-time insights from patient event data (e.g., admissions, discharges, lab results) to aid rapid clinical decisions. By leveraging SQL to extract and analyze streaming data, healthcare providers can receive immediate alerts and coordinate care more effectively.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** Leverage real-time healthcare event data to provide immediate alerts for care coordination.
- **Why It Matters:** Quick responses to critical events—like ER admissions or abnormal lab results—improve patient outcomes and reduce hospital readmissions.

---
## Features
1. **Event-Driven Alerts**: Flag critical events (e.g., high lab values, new admissions).
2. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Ingest and query streaming data for immediate insights.
3. **Notifications**: Potential integration with email or SMS alerts.

---
## Database Setup
*(To be detailed in upcoming steps. We will create a schema for patient events and lab results.)*

---
## Sample Data
*(We’ll add sample insert statements here in a future step.)*

---
## Key SQL Queries
*(We’ll provide queries to identify critical events, recent admissions, etc.)*

---
## Real-Time Notifications (Optional)
- Outline of how to trigger alerts (e.g., via cron jobs, Python scripts, or message queues).

---
## Usage Instructions
1. **Create the schema** with `schema.sql`.
2. **Insert sample data** with `sample_data.sql`.
3. **Run queries** from `queries.sql`.

---
## Next Steps
- Extend to other event types (e.g., prescription updates, imaging results).
- Integrate with third-party APIs or HL7/FHIR streams for real-world interoperability.
